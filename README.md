# custom-video-player

Custom video player using HTML5 `video` element and it's JavaScript API to customize the design of the player. 

I use this as a template for websites that hosts videos. 

# Description

HTML5 includes the `<video>` tag to embed videos into web pages. The attribute `controls` enables the default set of playback controls. 

The problem with native browser controls is that they are different in each browser - not good for cross-browser support. They also aren't very keyboard-accessible. The solution is to hide the native controls (removing `controls` attribute) and program your own with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
